🧠 C++ Logic Playground

Welcome to my personal collection of C++ experiments, algorithms, and logical problem-solving projects.
This repository is a place where I explore elegant, efficient, and creative solutions
to various computational and combinatorial challenges.

It serves as a laboratory of ideas – a space to test, refine, and document approaches
to algorithm design, data structures, and game-inspired simulations.

💡 Topics Covered

Graph traversals (DFS / BFS)

Optimization and search algorithms

Logical and mathematical puzzles

Recursive and simulation-based solutions

⚙️ Technologies

C++17 / C++20

Standard Template Library (STL): vector, unordered_map, queue, set

Visual Studio / g++

🎯 Goal

To build a personal library of intelligent solutions that demonstrate how
clean, structured, and efficient code can express even the most complex logic beautifully.
